  <p>During my time at Ae7, I was primarily a member of the 'Shell team' that oversaw all the exterior and interior fa√ßade elements of the project. I worked on a myriad of areas both in the Shell team and others.</p>
  <p>Although the work I did ranged from design, construction drawings, presentations, 3d modeling, and everything in between. I decided to present two tasks that I believe demonstrate the type of value I can bring to an organization.</p>
