  <p>The goal of this project was to design an application that would help users find recipes that use up the ingredients they already have at home and reduce food waste.</p>

<p>As someone who hates food waste, I always try to use everything I buy from the grocery store before it expires. But being as busy as I am and with limited culinary experience, it doesn’t usually go too well. I still find myself having to throw out those green beans that sat in the back of the fridge for too long. Or ruining an entire entree by insisting on putting in that wilted brown cilantro I didn’t have the heart to throw out. </p>

            <h3>The Larger<br/>Implications</h3>
            <div class="sub-section-line" style="color: #EDC700;"></div>
        </div>
        <p>Looking at the problem on a larger scale, in the United States, food waste is estimated at between 30-40 percent of the food supply.<br/>
        The best approach to reducing food loss and waste is not to create it in the first place. Waste can be avoided by improving cooking methods from the consumer level.

<p>The goal of this project was to design a hands free application that would help users find recipes that use up the ingredients they already have at home and reduce food waste.</p>

<p>To further understand the problem I decided to start with a heuristic evaluation of current applications that offer similar services.</p>

            <div class="sub-section-line" style="color: #EDC700;"></div>
        </div>
        <p>A common thread of complaints was that there was a cap to the number of ingredients the user can enter. In addition, the applications seemed to only accept broad, commonly used items and lacked the capability to accept specialty ingredients.
