<div class="project-intro">
  <p>The goal of this project was to design an application that would help users find recipes that use up the ingredients they already have at home and reduce food waste.</p>

<p>As someone who hates food waste, I always try to use everything I buy from the grocery store before it expires. But being as busy as I am and with limited culinary experience, it doesn’t usually go too well. I still find myself having to throw out those green beans that sat in the back of the fridge for too long. Or ruining an entire entree by insisting on putting in that wilted brown cilantro I didn’t have the heart to throw out. </p>

            <div class="sub-section-line" style="color: #EDC700;"></div>
        </div>
        <p>Looking at the problem on a larger scale, in the United States, food waste is estimated at between 30-40 percent of the food supply.<br/>
        The best approach to reducing food loss and waste is not to create it in the first place. Waste can be avoided by improving cooking methods from the consumer level.

        <p>Since the client wants a 'cross-fit' feel to the salon, I used the gym setting as inspiration. The floor treatment of the barber station echoes space markers in a traditional cross-fit gym. In an effort to draw on as much elements from the brand as possible, the floor treatment of the station is set at the same angle as the Fuel+ logo.</p>

<p class="body-copy">Since the client had yet to hone in on a location, the configuration of the stations will have to come later. They can either line the middle of the space or attach to walls.</p>

        <p>At the moment, Fuel Nutrition's biggest brand asset is the owner himself. Given how active he is as an 'influencer', I suggested that he incorporated a 'social media' moment in his salon that would encourage people to post a picture at the location. He could hire a local artist to create that moment and invite people to the event to get his brand name out.</p>
