<div class="project-intro">
  <p>Fuel Nutrition is a sports supplement store specifically targeted for young men. The client was looking to expand his business by opening up a flagship salon operating under the same brand.</p>
  <p>Although I was hired to put together a design concept package, this project evolved to include a set of business strategies and  action items for the client to consider in order to strengthen the Fuel Nutrition brand image.</p>

    <h3>Social Media Moment</h3>
    <p>At the moment, Fuel Nutrition's biggest brand asset is the owner himself. Given how active he is as an 'influencer', I suggested that he incorporated a 'social media' moment in his salon that would encourage people to post a picture at the location. He could hire a local artist to create that moment and invite people to the event to get his brand name out.</p>
