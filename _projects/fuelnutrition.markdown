<div class="project-intro">
  <p>Fuel Nutrition is a sports supplement store specifically targeted for young men. The client was looking to expand his business by opening up a flagship salon operating under the same brand.</p>
  <p>Although I was hired to put together a design concept package, this project evolved to include a set of business strategies and action items for the client to consider in order to strengthen the Fuel Nutrition brand image.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The client and I agreed that customers' first interaction with the space will be through the reception - waiting room and fuel bar. Material consistency should to be maintained within the spaces. Visual and functional connectivity between those 3 spaces would be advantageous for product sales.</p>

            <p>Barber station's look will mimic utility gym shelving. Potential to use reclaimed gym materials to build the stations. After researching dimensional requirements for salons I drafted a potential configuration. </p>

            </div>
            <p>Since the client wants a 'cross-fit' feel to the salon, I used the gym setting as inspiration. The floor treatment of the barber station echoes space markers in a traditional cross-fit gym. In an effort to draw on as much elements from the brand as possible, the floor treatment of the station is set at the same angle as the Fuel+ logo.</p>

    <p class="body-copy">Since the client had yet to hone in on a location, the configuration of the stations will have to come later. They can either line the middle of the space or attach to walls.</p>

            </div>
            <p>At the moment, Fuel Nutrition's biggest brand asset is the owner himself. Given how active he is as an 'influencer', I suggested that he incorporated a 'social media' moment in his salon that would encourage people to post a picture at the location. He could hire a local artist to create that moment and invite people to the event to get his brand name out.</p>
