<div class="project-intro">
  <p>When I was enrolled in Business Systems Platforms at the university of Pittsburgh we spent a week going over public API's and how one can use them.
3 peers and myself wrote a report on API's and their use in real and hypothetical scenarios. Months after the course was over I decided to design an application that applied those concepts and here it is, a case study on my portfolio. After laying out how the app would work, I gave myself a 2 day deadline to design and layout the application.</p>

            <p>The client and I agreed that customers' first interaction with the space will be through the reception - waiting room and fuel bar. Material consistency should to be maintained within the spaces. Visual and functional connectivity between those 3 spaces would be advantageous for product sales.</p>

            <p>Barber station's look will mimic utility gym shelving. Potential to use reclaimed gym materials to build the stations. After researching dimensional requirements for salons I drafted a potential configuration. </p>

    <p class="body-copy">Since the client had yet to hone in on a location, the configuration of the stations will have to come later. They can either line the middle of the space or attach to walls.</p>

            <p>At the moment, Fuel Nutrition's biggest brand asset is the owner himself. Given how active he is as an 'influencer', I suggested that he incorporated a 'social media' moment in his salon that would encourage people to post a picture at the location. He could hire a local artist to create that moment and invite people to the event to get his brand name out.</p>
