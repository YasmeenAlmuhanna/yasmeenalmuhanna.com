<div class="project-intro">
  <p>David Baker is a US-based software engineer who spends most of his free time hiking and doing all things outdoor-related.</p>
  <p>David approached me to create a simple new site to showcase his personality and work.</p>
  <p>I am in the process of designing the site, from concept to creation of graphics, to hover effects.</p>
  <p>Stay tuned to see how it develops!</p>

          <p>David expressed that he wanted his personal site to reflect his love of hiking and the outdoors.</p>
          <p>I had the idea of making his site one long hiking scene and started to experiment in my sketchbook.</p>
