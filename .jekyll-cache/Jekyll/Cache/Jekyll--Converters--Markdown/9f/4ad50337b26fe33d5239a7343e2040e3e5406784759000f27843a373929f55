<div class="project-intro">
  <p>During my time at Ae7, I was primarily a member of the 'Shell team' that oversaw all the exterior and interior fa√ßade elements of the project. I worked on a myriad of areas both in the Shell team and others.</p>
  <p>Although the work I did ranged from design, construction drawings, presentations, 3d modeling, and everything in between. I decided to present two tasks that I believe demonstrate the type of value I can bring to an organization.</p>

        <p>Our first step was to understand the angles that the Envista Taperdeck‚Ñ¢Ô∏è allowed between panels. From that understanding, we developed a connection detail to hold each panel in place. </p>

            <p>The challenging part about this task was that I am not trained in structural details of construction. I looked at many construction details from past built projects and stitched together first draft solution.</p>

            <p>Having done the structural coordination request package earlier allowed me to get acquainted with some of the structural members in the Dubai office. This enabled me to directly email some members my detail proposal and get feedback from them by the following morning.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I had to communicate with various in-house teams of the project in order to understand how one component fit with another.</p>
