                    <p>I wanted to make an online website to host selected works from my portfolio. My goal was to make a simple, and clean layout that was responsive for both web and mobile.</p>
                    <p>After hand sketching my ideas, I used AdobeXD to design and layout the pages. Each of the selected works has a theme color, so I decided to keep a monochromatic theme for the rest of the site so that the different colors do not compete. </p>
