    <p>
    I am a Designer and Business Strategist that is passionate about the meshing of these two worlds. I believe that successful design solutions inspire improvements to business practices and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>My greatest strength is in my holistic approach to solving problems. I have an inter-disciplinary background that grants me the ability to comfortably bridge the gaps between the technical, social and the aesthetic.  My goal is to lead diverse teams with multi-faceted skill-sets and help nurture and coordinate their skills to cultivate the best environment for collaboration and growth.
    </p>
    <p>My play is every bit as diverse as my work.  When I'm not busy with projects I like to keep busy rock climbing, baking, gardening, and all manner of fun with friends!  I like to challenge myself and am constantly expanding my comfort zone to include new activities like bungee jumping, spelunking, and white water!
